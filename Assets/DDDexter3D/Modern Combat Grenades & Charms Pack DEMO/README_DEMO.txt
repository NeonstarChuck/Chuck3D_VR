Open Unity Hub and create a 3D project using the Built-in Render Pipeline.
If using URP or HDRP, install the corresponding pipeline via Window > Package Manager.

2. Import the Asset Pack

Drag the package into the Unity Editor or use Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
The imported assets will be located in:
Assets/DDDexter3D/Modern Combat Grenades & Charms Pack DEMO/

3. Select the Correct Assets for Your Render Pipeline

Use the materials and prefabs from the appropriate folder:
Built-in: Materials/Built-in/
URP: Materials/URP/
HDRP: Materials/HDRP/

If materials appear pink, manually assign the correct URP Lit or HDRP Lit shader.
- Selecting only the necessary prefabs and materials for your render pipeline prevents unnecessary files from being imported, keeping your project organized and optimized.
